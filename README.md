# POLSKI SPOJ
This repository contains solutions to most problems I have solved on [POLSKI SPOJ](https://pl.spoj.com/). They're intended as a last resort in case you tried to solve a problem but you haven't been able to figure it out.

There is a comment at the beginning of each file that gives the used C++ version and compiler - C++14 (gcc 8.3) in most if not all cases.

The filename corresponds to the problem code on POLSKI SPOJ. For example: `PTEST.cc` is the solution file for https://pl.spoj.com/problems/PTEST/ problem.
